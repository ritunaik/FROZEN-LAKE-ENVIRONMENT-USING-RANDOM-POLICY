# FROZEN-LAKE-ENVIRONMENT-USING-RANDOM-POLICY



This Python code explores the OpenAI Gym environment "FrozenLake-v1" using the Gymnasium library. It demonstrates how to interact with the environment, take actions, and observe rewards and transitions.

## About the Code

The code consists of Python scripts that interact with the "FrozenLake-v1" Gym environment, a simple grid-world environment where an agent must navigate from the start to the goal while avoiding holes in the ice. The code showcases the following functionality:

1. Initializing the Gym environment and rendering it in a human-readable format.
2. Accessing the observation space and action space of the environment.
3. Querying the transition probabilities for state-action pairs using `env.P`.
4. Taking deterministic and random actions in the environment.
5. Running episodes with random actions and calculating returns.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the Gymnasium library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install gymnasium
   
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

Navigate to the project directory :
cd your-repo

Run the main Python script to explore the FrozenLake environment :
python main.py
Follow the code comments and output to understand the functionality and behavior of the code.
